# Project 4: CG, BFGS, and SR1

Description: This project is aim to solve optimization problems using the conjugate gradient method and the quasi-Newton methods. The conjugate method will be perform on a few matrices to test its performances and compare with other built-in functions. The quasi-Newton methods (BFGS and SR1) will be test on Rosenbrock function and Powell's quartic function and compare against the iterations of the standard Newton's method (step length equals 1).

## Compile/Run the code

The codes are written on jupyter notebooks using python. One can review it by opening the file "main.ipynb" using jupyter notebook. 

## Contributors
This project is written by Haley Feng with the help of the starter code provided by the professor.
