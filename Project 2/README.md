# Project 2: Backtracking and Heavy ball

Description: This project is aimed to write a program that solve optimatization problems with the implement of backtracking algorithm to select step length and the heavy ball method. The codes will include the implementation of backtracking to inexact steepest descent and newton's method algorithms, a function for the heavy ball method, and example functions that will test out the efficiency of these methods when compared to ones tested in Project 1.  

## Compile/Run the code

The codes are written on jupyter notebooks using python. One can review it by opening "main.py" or "main.ipynb" using jupyter notebook. 

## Contributors
This project is written by Haley Feng with the help of the starter code provided by the professor.
