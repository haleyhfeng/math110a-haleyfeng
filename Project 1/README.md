# Project 1: Steepest Descent Method

Description: This project is aimed to write a program that solve optimatization problems with the Steepest Descent Method. The codes will include the exact and inexact steepest descent algorithms and two example functions that will test out the two methods. 

## Compile/Run the code

The codes are written on jupyter notebooks using python. One can review it by opening "main.py" or "main.ipynb" using jupyter notebook. 

## Contributors
This project is written by Haley Feng with the help of the starter code provided by the professor.
