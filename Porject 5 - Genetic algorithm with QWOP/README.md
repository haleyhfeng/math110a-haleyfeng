# Project 5: Genetic Algorithm with QWOP

Description: This project is aim to write the algorithm of Differential Evolution (DE) and implement it to the case of QWOP. The idea is to keep a population of solutions and create new solutions by combining existing ones according to very simply rules. Then keep whichever solutions that has the best score or fitness on the optimization problem. The algorithm returns the best of the population and its best score. 

## Compile/Run the code

The codes are written on jupyter notebooks using python. One can review it by opening the file "main.ipynb" using jupyter notebook. 

## Contributors
This project is written by Haley Feng with the help of the starter code provided by the professor.
